          <h3>Is child sponsorship an effective way to help?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. When you sponsor a child, you help bring long-term changes to
            that child’s community, creating a happier and healthier environment
            in which to grow up.
          </p>

          <h3>Is the money I give to World Vision handled responsibly?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We account for every dollar. Of the funds given to World Vision
            in 2016, 80.5% went directly to programs that help children and
            families, 13.5% went to fundraising, and 6% was allocated to
            administration. Audits are conducted regularly by external firms to
            verify the accuracy of our financial reporting. To learn more about
            how donations are used, check out our latest Annual Report.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I adopt or bring a sponsored child to Canada?</h3>
          <p>
            No. We do not organize adoption or bringing children to Canada for
            visits. Your help to improve a child’s quality of life and
            self-reliance in their own countries and cultures has deeper value
            than moving them to a foreign country.
          </p>

          <h3>What is my Expected Delivery Timing For Receiving Order?</h3>
          <p>
            We will send your items by mail, within 7 to 10 business days. There
            is no extra cost charged to you for shipping and handling.
