              Despite the challenges of COVID-19, our organization has continued
              our work and service in the community. If you feel sick, then call
              911 right away. Wash hand more frequently, keep distance two-meter
              apart, wear a face mask when necessary, and avoid unnecessary
              travel. Thank you for your continued support of our organization.
              Together, we will get through this health crisis.

              We have created a temporary support program called fresh food for
              kids, which provides nutritious food baskets to local families in
              need. We delivered enough food and supplies for a family of four
              to five people for four weeks. For those who can give, any amount
              will make a difference in providing healthy, nutritious food to
              kids in need.

              this year. More than 90% of our clients are children under the age
              of 18, and the economic downturn is causing great difficulty for
              the families who need help putting food on the table.
